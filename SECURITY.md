# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: security@tiangolo.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I (the author, [@tiangolo](https://twitter.com/tiangolo)) will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. ðŸ™Š

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
